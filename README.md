#Background
* Youtube has a new feature to play your video in a tiny window but that window can't be furthur positioned and if we go to some other application ,the video is paused and can't be played.
* This PWVP overcomes those issues. The video playing in the tiny window can be positioned on any side of the screen. One can shift to other app and the video will still continue playing in that window.
